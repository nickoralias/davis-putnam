To run my programs, simply enter the path of the input files when prompted.
You will also be prompted to enter the desired path to the output file.  You need not create this file before typing the desired path.  Use the output of FrontEnd as the input for DavisPutnam and the output of DavisPutnam as the input for BackEnd :)

The format of the input file desribes a maze.  The first line is the different nodes, the second line the different treasures, and the third line the max number of steps to solve the maze.
Each subsequent line gives the name of the node, the word "TREASURES" followed by the list of treasures available at that node separated by spaces, the world "TOLLS" followed by a list of tolls required by that node, and finally the word "NEXT" followed by the nodes it is connected to via an edge.
